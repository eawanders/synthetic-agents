# Week 1 ‚Äî Day 1: Python Basics

## üéØ Learning goals
- Get comfortable running Python scripts from the terminal.
- Practice variables, types, and printing.
- Use f-strings to format output.
- Perform arithmetic operations (`+`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`).
- Work with strings: case conversion, slicing, and length.
- (Stretch) Use `input()` and conditionals to handle user interaction.

## üìù Exercises

1. **Variables & Types**
   - Create variables for your `name` (string), `age` (integer), and `score` (float).
   - Print them out with `print()` and check their types with `type()`.

2. **f-strings**
   - Use an f-string to print:
     ```
     Edward is 25 years old and has a score of 3.7.
     ```

3. **Arithmetic**
   - With `x = 7` and `y = 3`, print:
     - sum, product, true division, integer division, modulo, power (`x**y`).

4. **String operations**
   - With `text = "Agent-Based Modelling"`, print:
     - Length of the string.
     - Lowercased and uppercased versions.
     - The first 5 characters.
     - The last 9 characters.

5. **Booleans**
   - Check if `age >= 18`.
   - Print `"Adult"` or `"Minor"` based on the result.

6. **Stretch (Optional)**
   - Ask the user for an integer using `input()`.
   - Print whether the number is even or odd.
   - If the input is not an integer, print `"That wasn‚Äôt an integer!"`.
